## C++

### What should i learn?

-   difference of c and c++
-   basic types
-   classes
    -   public
    -   **protected**
        -   used for inherit class to access the method or variable
        -   don't allow to call the method or use the varible directly
    -   private
-   variable types
    -   virtual
        -    allow a member function of a class to be overridden in derived classes
        -    used similar as abstract in java
        -    also remember virtual destructure
        -    ~ in cpp is destructure
-   stl
    -   vector
        -   vector<T>
            -   can use int, double, custom class, and pointer (pointer is weird)
-   what is objective c
-   start on the project
-   some fancy way of using cpp
