## C++

### What should i learn?

-   difference of c and c++
-   basic types
    -   arrays
        -   int x[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...};
    -   strings
        -   cstrings
            -   char str[] = "C++";
        -   get string functions
            -   cin >> str
            -   cin.get(str, 100);
            -   if use string str; we can use getline(cin, str);
        -   c++ string class
            -   find(), rfind() - find the last occur substring, append(), insert(), erase(), replace(), compare()
        -   
-   classes
    -   public
    -   **protected**
        -   used for inherit class to access the method or variable
        -   don't allow to call the method or use the varible directly
    -   private
-   variable types
    -   virtual
        -    allow a member function of a class to be overridden in derived classes
        -    used similar as abstract in java
        -    also remember virtual destructure
        -    ~ in cpp is destructure
-   stl
    -   vector
        -   vector<T>
            -   can use int, double, custom class, and pointer (pointer is weird)
-  operaters
   -  &	Binary AND
   -  |	Binary OR
   -  ^	Binary XOR
   -  ~	Binary One's Complement
   -  <<	Binary Shift Left
   -  \>>	Binary Shift Right
   -  &	represents memory address of the operand	&num; // address of num
   -  .	accesses members of struct variables or class objects	s1.marks = 92;
   -  ->	used with pointers to access the class or struct variables	ptr->marks = 92;
   -  <<	prints the output value	cout << 5;
   -  \>>	gets the input value	cin >> num;
-   function
    -   inline function in cpp
        -   this will copy the function itself to where the argument are to make running faster
    -   auto function: can use as function return type and lambda function input parameter type
-   what is objective c
-   start on the project
-   some fancy way of using cpp
