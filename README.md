# LeetCode
My LeetCode Path and C++ language learning

## Purpose
- get familiar with algorithms
- start with using java but later start to use c++

## Focus Topics
- loops
  - 
- linklist
  - how it different from c as have new
  - nullptr use
- trees
- Dynamic Programming
  1. state the subproblem to solve
  2. solving the original problem by subproblems
  3. recursive formula to computer the subproblem
  - 1D array or 2D array both possible
- vector use
  - string manipulation
  - integer / string change
  - double vector (2D array)
- integer
  - overflow handle
  - INT_MAX, INT_MIN
  - module and divide
  - palindrome
- binary search
  - find mid and update low / high
- divide and conquer
  - calculate some thing about this case
  - then call max/min of three cases (left, this, right)
